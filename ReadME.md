## Data

Multiple Data sets were provided for analysis by the company and each contains various categorical type information on previous films released.  For example, some of the categories in the data sets provided include each films release date, length, allocated budget, rating, number of ratings, domestic profit, world wide profit, etc.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis to determine potential business insights.  This project also identifies various relationships on various categories of previous films released.

## Results

In all of the exploratory analysis of the data sets provided, the most potentially significant findings for Microsoft to keep in mind in its development of a new studio include the following statements.

1. When looking at all films that had both a domestic and world wide profit greater than zero, there was a strong positive relationship between each films profit and allocated budget.
2. When looking at all films that had both a domestic and world wide profit greater than zero, it was found that June had the highest average domestic profit with October having the highest world wide average profit.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to several recommendations for improving Microsoft's studio chance at success and profit.

- The relationship between a films allocated budget and both domestic and world wide profit is positive.
- It would be best to further research the best time period or season for the release of a film.
- It would be highly valuable to further research the impact of a films release date, location, and crew on the overall domestic and world wide profit relative to their initial budget.
